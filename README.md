# vapor_sam_addon

This directory keeps source files that Sam adds to the vapor package.

Users should add entries in the vapor code repository, and link to the 
corresponding files in this direction. 
For example, put links in the vapor-src/include/vapor/ directory to link 
to header files here;
put links in the vapor-src/lib/vdf/ directory to link .cpp files here; and
and create corresponding application folders in the vapor-src/apps/ 
directory and link source files here.
